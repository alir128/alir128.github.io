This is a simple game I made using HTML CSS and Javascript. It involved basic code for practicing my skills.

The game shows a RGB color at the top which the use has to guess using the values given.
The user can play in a easy mode which gives only 3 choices and hard mode gives 6 colors to choose from.

ENJOY!
